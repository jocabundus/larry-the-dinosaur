-  STORY>>>

                Year, 65000 B.C., aliens are invading the earth.  Larry, a
           dinosaur and your team of five other dinosaurs have been assigned
           to rid these aliens of the face of the earth.  You and your team
           go into the mountains where the aliens started to invade.  You
           fight them, but every once in a while a team member would die by
           getting eaten by rockmonsters, mutilated by jelly blobs, guts
           getting sqeezed out by dangerous plants, or stepping on blobs that
           detanate when you step on them. Larry is the only one left. He
           must finish the job.  It may seem like a suicide mission, but if
           anybody can do it, Larry can, or will he?

                Meanwhile, two dinosaurs, Matt and Gary, are hiking in the
           mountains that the aliens are invading.  They discover some of
           Larry's team members dead, and the hideous creatures that killed
           them.  They are now trying to escape off of the mountain before
           they die.  Will they make it Alive?

                On the aliens side, Xenophobe is the leader of them all.  He
           has the command of all the aliens.  If you destroy him, you won
           the battle, but have you won the war?
                
                Your just going to have to play the game to see how this
           epic story ends.  Can you survive the horror?

-  ALIENS>>>

  Rockmonster - These guys will follow you where ever you go, they
                might be hard to kill, or easy, or you can jump over them in
                some cases.  You touch these guys and they will consume you
                horribaly.

  Blob Mine   - These are little purple blobs that will explode if
                you touch them, so be careful.

  Jelly Blob  - Floating jelly fish type of things.  Their tentacles will
                multilate you in seconds.  These Jelly Blobs are stong, so
                if you can jump over them with out dieing, do it.  It's alot
                better than using up 5 to 10 good shots.

  Venus
  Dinosaur    - These will grab a hold of you and sqeeze the guts out of you.
  Trap          Be sure not to touch them; however, you have a chance of it       
                not grabbing you, but I wouldn't take that chance.

==============================================================================

-  THE GAME>>>

                There are three epsiodes to this game.  Episode 1 - Escape
              From The Mountains,  Episode 2 - Mexico Shootout (I know there
              was no mexico back then, but hey, sounds good to me!), and
              Episode 3 - Xenophobe Must Die.

                Each episode gets harder as you go along.  You don't have
              much ammo, so your going to have to use you jump in some cases.
              Preserve your ammo for when you need it.  If you can survive
              jumping over something than shooting it, jump over it.  Some
              aliens you can't kill, like the blob mines and plants.  Jump
              over those.  Be careful, you can walk into an ambush, be aware.
